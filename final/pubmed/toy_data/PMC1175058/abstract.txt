{{Introduction}} Studies on the association between the cytochrome P450c17α gene ( CYP17 ) 5'-untranslated region  Msp A1 genetic polymorphism and breast cancer risk have yielded inconsistent results. Higher levels of estrogen have been reported among young nulliparous women with the A2 allele. Therefore we assessed the impact of  CYP17  genotypes on the risk of premenopausal breast cancer, with emphasis on parity. {{Methods}} We used data from a population-based case–control study of women aged below 51 years conducted from 1992 to 1995 in Germany. Analyses were restricted to clearly premenopausal women with complete information on  CYP17  and encompassed 527 case subjects and 904 controls, 99.5% of whom were of European descent. The  Msp A1 polymorphism was analyzed using PCR-RFLP (PCR–restriction fragment length polymorphism) assay. {{Results}} The frequencies of the variant allele among the cases and controls were 43% and 41%, respectively. Overall,  CYP17  A1/A2 and A2/A2 genotypes compared with the A1/A1 genotype were not associated with breast cancer, with adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of 1.04 and 1.23, respectively. Among nulliparous women, however, breast cancer risk was elevated for the A1/A2 (OR = 1.31; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 2.32) and the A2/A2 genotype (OR = 2.12; 95% CI 1.04 to 4.32) compared with the A1/A1 genotype, with a trend towards increasing risk associated with number of A2 alleles ( P  = 0.04). Otherwise, the  CYP17  polymorphism was found neither to be an effect modifier of breast cancer risks nor to be associated with stage of disease. {{Conclusion}} Our results do not indicate a major influence of  CYP17 Msp A1 polymorphism on the risk of premenopausal breast cancer, but suggest that it may have an impact on breast cancer risk among nulliparous women. The finding, however, needs to be confirmed in further studies.
